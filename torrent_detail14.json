The lovable, confident, tough, furry blue behemoth-like giant monster named James P. Sullivan (better known as Sulley) and his wisecracking best friend, short, green cyclops monster Mike Wazowski, discover what happens when the real world interacts with theirs in the form of a 2-year-old baby girl dubbed \"Boo,\" who accidentally sneaks into the monster world with Sulley one night. And now it's up to Sulley and Mike to send Boo back in her door before anybody finds out, especially two evil villains such as Sulley's main rival as a scarer, chameleon-like Randall (a monster that Boo is very afraid of), who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin, and Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose, the chairman and chief executive officer of Monsters, Inc.", "yt_trailer_code": "cvOQeozL4S0", "language": "English", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/large-cover.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/medium-screenshot1.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/medium-screenshot2.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/medium-screenshot3.jpg", "large_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/large-screenshot1.jpg", "large_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/large-screenshot2.jpg", "large_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Monsters_Inc_2001/large-screenshot3.jpg", "cast": [{"name": "Jennifer Tilly", "character_name": "Celia", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000236.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000236"}, {"name": "John Goodman", "character_name": "James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000422.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000422"}, {"name": "Steve Buscemi", "character_name": "Randall Boggs", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000114.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000114"}, {"name": "Bonnie Hunt", "character_name": "Flint", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001372.jpg", "imdb_code": "0001372"}], "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/0D0ED8C5837E40710D6CB6426EB01DA99F45D1BD", "hash": "0D0ED8C5837E40710D6CB6426EB01DA99F45D1BD", "quality": "3D", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 10, "peers": 3, "size": "1.50 GB", "size_bytes": 1610612736, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 23:43:18", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446417798}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/455240895FAF3D54ED89165CBCF0AA8D745E263D", "hash": "455240895FAF3D54ED89165CBCF0AA8D745E263D", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 176, "peers": 13, "size": "601.68 MB", "size_bytes": 630907208, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 01:11:49", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446336709}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/D67281864031E5012B056C32EBDC6F9E33C42A44", "hash": "D67281864031E5012B056C32EBDC6F9E33C42A44", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 259, "peers": 55, "size": "1.45 GB", "size_bytes": 1556925645, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 01:11:50", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446336710}], "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 01:11:49", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446336709}, {"id": 2080, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/monsters-university-2013", "imdb_code": "tt1453405", "title": "Monsters University", "title_english": "Monsters University", "title_long": "Monsters University (2013)", "slug": "monsters-university-2013", "year": 2013, "rating": 7.3, "runtime": 104, "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Comedy", "Family", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "download_count": 970335, "like_count": 1223, "description_intro": "Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (John Goodman) are an inseparable pair, but that wasn't always the case.

Fast-forwarding to the present day, we meet three very different women, each of whom struggles to maintain control of their lives. There's Elizabeth, a smart and successful lawyer who uses her body to her advantage. Any time she feels that she doesn't have the upper hand, and cannot control the situation, she uses her sex appeal - whether that be starting a romance with her boss when she suspects he is trying to start one himself, or finding some way to control her overly friendly neighbor and husband. Karen, meanwhile, is a bitter health care professional who obviously has a lot of heart but never shows it.
