Feisty TICKY is like a tjara artful dodger - cheeky and daring with a streetwise swagger and little respect for rules. He escapes the realities of his 80's Sugarhill District existence by living in a Bollywood dream world where he's an unbeatable action hero. Rooftops are his kingdom. When chubby, timid BABOO moves into the neighbourhood with his snooty, academic dad, Ticky thinks he's the biggest loser he's ever seen - but soon the two boys are drawn together by the shared threat of local bully and crime boss, RAJA. These two nine year-old misfits decide to rid their community of the evil Raja. Their plan - emulate the antics and mannerisms of Bollywood hereos. The battle between escapism and harsh reality is not evenly matched, yet these heroes share a loyalty so special that it can conquer all.",

In addition to rock icons there are family members and lovers to present a unique artist in full both simple and complex. It also has a much shyer off stage Hendrix explaining his craft. Last and by far most we have the artist on stage blowing away the audience. Having grown up in that era I had never heard a sound like his and from the response in the neighborhood, the country and among his peers (Clapton, Townsend, The Beatles etc.) the verdict was unanimous, he was a rock superstar that not only played guitar better and more outlandishly than anyone in the business but also had an outstanding blues/rock voice along with interpretive skills that made covers ( Hey Joe, All Along the Watchtower, Wild Thing) superior to the original as well as pen Blues masterpieces like Red House. The Jimi Hendrix experience for this teen if I may use the term was one awesome ride.So it is better late than never in the true sense that American Masters pays tribute to American rock's most iconic symbol in an era that might draw new fans away from the mediocrity to be found in the industry these days consisting of rhyming simpletons who can't play a note, pole dancers and manufactured pop stars selected by committee. I realize we can't pass down our idols but the way Hendrix transcends time he is one of the few rockers well worth a look back at.",

It's here among the cotton fields and gravel roads where his father Henry lives and works as a crop duster pilot. Jake has never met his father, but holds him responsible for all of life's troubles- failure, jail, the death of his mother. Jake travels to the south with the intention of revenge. However, once he gets to this small town big things start to happen. It's here with nothing that he finds everything - life, love and a gospel record contract. And Jake learns that his momma may not have been quite so innocent through it all. Jake soon becomes part of a colorful ensemble cast that is as authentic and soulful as it gets. This is a movie about people, the characters just as important as the location. This musical movie has the heart and feel of a foreign film, but its country of origin just happens to be the Arkansas delta.",
