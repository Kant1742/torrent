Jasna has been traumatized by what she witnessed in Serbia, and the after-effects are exacerbated by the menial jobs she must take to pay the rent despite being a trained architect. Meanwhile, Nina must deal with the regular tensions of high-school life, which are complicated by poverty and her mother's volatile psychological state. Worse, one of Nina's teachers insists she intern at a local theatre company to make up for past transgressions. Plagued by the past, the two women are unable to find common ground and both veer towards the breaking point.",

Whitt (Justin Bruening), whose snooty father wants Whitt to follow him into corporate law, is insulted by the low-class assignment, especially after he meets Kylie Burch (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), the woman he has to help. Kylie and Whitt clash at first, and it looks like Whitt will never be able to help her if he doesn't understand her situation.

But Bismarck has something more sinister in mind for Harry and the Prince.",
        "synopsis": "Captain Harry Flashman (Malcolm McDowell) of the British Army is a cad, a coward, and a lecher who always seems to come off inadvertently heroic. While romancing renowned courtesan Lola Montez (Florinda Bolkan), Harry is recruited against his will by Otto Von Bismarck (Oliver Reed) to substitute for a look-a-like Prussian Prince ostensibly in order to help Bismarck enlarge his hold over German duchies. But Bismarck has something more sinister in mind for Harry and the Prince.",

John Paul's desire for revenge is swayed as he falls for Winnie Power, the daughter of the man he suspects killed his father. John Paul must now battle between his consuming passion for justice versus his desire to be with the woman he now loves.",
