Mother's Little Helpers is a funny dysfunctional-family drama, based on true events and inspired by true lies, about how family ties can twist and tear you - and though they may not break you, they might send you to prison. It explores the \"OK, Boomer\" relationship between the free love generation and those left to clean up the mess.",

Before leaving, he visits his friends, a tribe of snake-wielding women warriors. He finds that they have been attacked, and their leader, Princess Yin-Yin, toward whom he has some romantic feelings, has been abducted. The attacker is her evil uncle Fong, who years before overthrew Yin-Yin's father and took over their sect. Fong also has possession of a sacred scroll which tells how to achieve ultimate martial arts power. Blademaster decides to help Yin-Yin and her imprisoned father, and his romantic complications deepen when his childhood chum and Yin-Yin are joined by a new rival. Blademaster thinks she is an innocent village girl he has saved, but in fact she is Fong! The process of gaining ultimate martial arts power requires self- castration and transmogrification into female form.",

When Halley and Peter learn that Dag and Rebecca have slept together (it started with just a kiss), Halley leaves Dag, and Peter is wounded. In their suffering, Halley meets Andre, a cellist; Peter meets Colleen, Andre's wife; and, a remorseful Dag meets Paula, an edgy waitress with a crush on Peter. Couplings follow; then, several characters end up in hospital. Paula becomes an avenging angel, and Peter may be her next victim. Is there any way these relationships can be set right?

The radicalised children of the Nazi generation lead by Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof and Gudrun Ensslin are fighting a violent war against what they perceive as the new face of fascism: American imperialism supported by the German establishment, many of whom have a Nazi past. Their aim is to create a more human society but by employing inhuman means they not only spread terror and bloodshed, they also lose their own humanity. The man who understands them is also their hunter: the head of the German police force Horst Herold. And while he succeeds in his relentless pursuit of the young terrorists, he knows he's only dealing with the tip of the iceberg.",

        "summary": "Valley Inn tells the story of Emily Mason, a New Jersey college student, who finds herself in a dusty dying small southern town, a thousand miles from home, selling Christian books door-to-door. Through a series of misadventures in 'the Book field,' and her growing friendships with the endearing and often comical local residents, Emily begins to discover what is most valuable in life, at the Valley Inn. More than a movie, Valley Inn is a love-letter to small town America. A tribute to a quickly vanishing way of life. And above all, as all movies should, Valley Inn entertains and transports the audience.
