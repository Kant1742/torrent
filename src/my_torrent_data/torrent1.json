Milla soon shows everyone in her orbit - her parents, Moses, a sensitive music teacher, a budding child violinist, and a disarmingly honest pregnant neighbour - how to live like you have nothing to lose. What might have been a disaster for the Finlay family instead leads to letting go and finding grace in the glorious chaos of life. Babyteeth joyously explores how good it is not to be dead yet and how far we will go for love.",

Several years before, she performed a cesarean section on a woman who did not survive, and the patient's husband, Yann (Pio Marma\u00ef), driven mad by grief, abducted Anna and intended to punish her for the death of his wife and child. However, after spending several days together in Yann's basement, he and Anna discovered their contempt for one another was giving way to more complex emotions, which complicate both of their senses of justice.
