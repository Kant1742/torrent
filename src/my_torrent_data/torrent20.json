To take care of the ageing writer who suffers from chronic dementia, the property's manager hires the gentle and soft-spoken live-in hospice nurse, Lily Saylor; however, this is far from an ordinary job. Little by little, Lily's imagination will run wild, as shadowy sightings of eerie female spectres blur the frail boundaries between reality and fantasy, fable and truth.

The Edge is a compelling, funny and emotional insight into a band of brothers' rise to the top, their unmatched achievements and the huge toll it would take. One of the toughest sports on the planet, and psychologically perhaps the most challenging. Featuring unseen footage from the period and new interviews from star players and coaching staff including: Andrew Strauss, Sir Alastair Cook, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott and Andy Flower, The Edge will reveal the team's intense and often hilarious pursuit of success. Strauss and Flower took over a team including some of the true greats of the English game (Pietersen, Anderson, Cook and Broad) and transformed them into a phenomenal winning machine before the pressure and scrutiny began to fracture bodies and minds.",

Drifting through his gap year with internships and travel plans, Jack (Will Poulter) has always suspected there was more to life than this. A chance encounter with the beautiful and ethereal Evelyn (Alma Jodorowsky) and her friends, including free spirited Viola (Cara Delevingne), swerves his life radically off course. She is like no one he's ever met before, and he quickly becomes caught up in a whirlwind of all-day parties and wild nights in London's hidden dives with her charismatic friends. Giving up everything to follow Evelyn and her hedonistic lifestyle, it takes Jack a while to realise what he's leaving behind, that love isn't a game you want to lose and that these people might not be the kindred spirits he first thought.",

Now a bored housewife trapped in a less-than-ideal-marriage , and mourning the independence of her 10-year-old-son, Rose accepts an invitation to teach a life skills class at a women's shelter. Digging out the relics of her pageant queen past, Rose attempts to share her \"Making Your Presence a Present\" platform speech with a room of four disinterested women dodging abusive exes. But when trouble shows up at the shelter, what the women really need is for Rose's shiny Escalade to get them out of dodge. The five embark on an all-night adventure through L.A.'s darkest streets and wildest drag club as the women fight to survive, and in so doing, discover what they need most. This one's an anthem for any woman who's ever been told to sit still and be pretty. This one's for the marginalized. This one's for the girls.",

The Thing in the Woods, directed by Alejandro Brugu\u00e9s is a pastiche which throws in every cliche from slashers to alien spiders. Mirare directed by Joe Dante deals with the weirder aspects of cosmetic surgery philia, taking it far beyond any logical conclusion. Mashit directed by Ry\u00fbhei Kitamura takes place in a Boarding School where staff and pupils are possessed by Demons. This Way to Egress directed by David Slade is filmed in dark monochrome, a woman loses touch with reality and seems to have crossed into a frightening parallel universe. Dead directed by Mick Garris is set in a hospital where a boy fights evil spirits and a real life murder.",

        "description_full": "HONDROS follows the life and career of famous war photographer Chris Hondros by exploring the poignant and often surprising stories behind this award-winning photojournalist's best-known photos. Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.",
