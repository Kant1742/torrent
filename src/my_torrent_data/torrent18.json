The deli is the main love in this man's life. While the film also covers other famous Jewish delis in Manhattan, Queens, Los Angeles and San Francisco and their histories, the emphasis is on the cultural aspects of the food and how the culture and the desire for this food is disappearing. There were once thousands of these delis and now there's fewer than 150 left in the entire U.S. Such luminaries as Larry King, Jerry Stiller, Fyvush Finkel, Freddie Roman and Alan Dershowitz as well as various deli owners express their love for the culture and the food.",

One day, a mysterious Frenchman, Adrien Rivoire, comes to town both to pay his respects to Frantz's grave and to contact that soldier's parents.

        "synopsis": "A movie studio is being torn down. TV interviewer Genya Tachibana has tracked down its most famous star, Chiyoko Fujiwara, who has been a recluse since she left acting some 30 years ago. Tachibana delivers a key to her, and it causes her to reflect on her career; as she's telling the story, Tachibana and his long-suffering cameraman are drawn in. The key was given to her as a teenager by a painter and revolutionary that she helped to escape the police. She becomes an actress because it will make it possible to track him down, and she spends the next several decades acting out that search in various genres and eras.",

Over a fourteen year period they were the heartbeat on every hit from Motown's Detroit era. By the end of their phenomenal run, this unheralded group of musicians had played on more number ones hits than the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, Elvis and the Beatles combined - which makes them the greatest hit machine in the history of popular music. They called themselves the Funk Brothers. Forty-one years after they played their first note on a Motown record and three decades since they were all together, the Funk Brothers reunited back in Detroit to play their music and tell their unforgettable story, with the help of archival footage, still photos, narration, interviews, re-creation scenes, 20 Motown master tracks, and twelve new live performances of Motown classics with the Brothers backing up contemporary performers.",

Made with unprecedented access, GAME OF THRONES: THE LAST WATCH is an up-close and personal portrait from the trenches of production, following the crew and the cast as they contend with extreme weather, punishing deadlines and an ever-excited fandom hungry for spoilers. Much more than a \"making of\" documentary, this is a funny, heartbreaking story, told with wit and intimacy, about the bittersweet pleasures of what it means to create a world - and then have to say goodbye to it.",

She's a fascinating paradox, at once subdued and adventurous: One moment, she's meekly enduring the affectionate nagging of her anxious mother Eram; the next, she's racing through their Chicago suburb on her skateboard.",

        "synopsis": "Jean (Virginia McKenna) and Matt (Bill Travers) are a struggling married couple, with Matt trying to scrape out a living as a writer. Out of the blue, they receive a telegram informing them that Matt's long-lost uncle has died and left them his business - a cinema in the town of Sloughborough. They pack their bags and travel to Sloughborough expecting to sell the cinema to gain a huge inheritance. However, they discover the cinema is falling apart and is run by a comically incompetant staff who seem to have worked there forever. They set out with a plan to sell it, but things don't quite go as planned.",

        "summary": "Diggsy Ellston has been in love with Suzette Larking since he was a boy. When Suzette gets married to another man, Diggsy meets a stranger who offers him an unbelievable gift: the unusual possibility of finding another Suzette. This offering comes in the form of a key that opens doors into parallel universes. Universes where other versions of Suzette may not only exist, but where one of them could even possibly love him. Sounds magical, but there's one major catch: Once Diggsy uses the key, he can't go back; he will forever leave everyone and everything he has ever known. Diggsy's hesitation lies in the strong bond he shares with his sister, Daphne, but he justifies his decision to leave on the belief that she wants him to move on in life. With every new universe comes a new decision: Stay or leave? Settle or keep chasing the dream of finding a Suzette who will love him? Diggsy's journey is filled with comedy, heartbreak, adventure, and a heavy dose of fish out of water.",

They fall in love, she gets pregnant but it's assumed to be someone else's, who she marries. A monk at the monastery knows the truth, and confronts Masao, who goes off instead to the master sculptor to be his assistant, only to then begin another affair with his wife, who in turn seduces her young son who, in horror, blames the whole business on Masao and sets out to kill him.",

During a fire, Harry observes that the local bank is left empty and open without any security. Soon he plots a scheme to rob the bank, provoking a fire in his room to distract the employees. When Harry meets George's wife Dolly Harshaw, the easy woman teases him and they have sex. Harry becomes the prime suspect of the bank heist and is arrested, but Dolly provides the necessary alibi to release him and then blackmails him into having a love affair with her. However, Harry falls in love with Gloria Harper, who works as an accountant at the dealership. He discovers that Gloria is being blackmailed by the despicable Frank Sutton, and he decides to press Sutton.",

When Paul becomes physically blinded in a freak accident, he is forced to reconsider what true beauty means - and where it comes from. With the help of Abigail, a recovering alcoholic and down-on-her-luck singer, Paul realizes the meaning of love and the power of the Gospel to change people's lives. Although he can no longer see, for the first time in his life, his eyes are open. A film of faith and forgiveness, \"Open My Eyes\" proves that even the hardest hearts can be turned and that broken lives can be healed if only we are willing to believe.",
