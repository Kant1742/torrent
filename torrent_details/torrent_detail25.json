Later, she's found dead by her former associates, Mike and Carlino, small-time hoods, in Susy's basement apartment. (Both occupants of the apartment are then absent.) The doll woman's newer partner in crime, Harry Rote, who murdered her for self-dealing, presses Mike and Carlino into a scheme to recover the doll, which contains a fortune in smuggled heroin. After disposing of the body, the thugs return while Susy is present to continue their search. They assume Susy's blindness will enable them to search her apartment under her very nose for the doll. In Sam's absence, Mike pretends to be an old friend of Sam's, while the three together spin for Susy a story of a murder investigation of her husband from which only the finding of the missing doll can save him.

Sixteen year old Jeannie Dougall is slightly dim, naive and lacks any self-confidence, immersing herself in the romantic lives of characters she sees on the movie screen as witnessed by the pictures she has plastered on her bedroom wall. Anything that Jeannie tries that is new or different is usually a result of being egged on by her more experienced best friend, Dolly, who flaunts her burgeoning sexuality. Jeannie lives with her working class parents, Jim and Mary Dougall, Scottish immigrants who live by their conservative and religious beliefs. Jim is a member of the Honor Guard, and has a view that anyone who wears a uniform in service to the country, such as his and Mary's son Jimmie Dougall, is to be admired regardless. Jimmie's non-battle service in Canada is in munitions requisitions.
