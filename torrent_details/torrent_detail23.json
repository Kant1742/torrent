But Ian starts to receive strange messages from his old and broken down TV set that make him realize that The Mold may not be as helpful as it seems to be, and strange characters combined with stranger events cast Ian's life in the shadow of an epic battle between good and evil that Ian is only partially aware of.", "yt_trailer_code": "ToRhJWIBZrE", "language": "English", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/large-cover.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/medium-screenshot1.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/medium-screenshot2.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/medium-screenshot3.jpg", "large_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/large-screenshot1.jpg", "large_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/large-screenshot2.jpg", "large_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/motivational_growth_2013/large-screenshot3.jpg", "cast": [{"name": "Jeffrey Combs", "character_name": "The Mold", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001062.jpg", "imdb_code": "0001062"}], "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/AC1DB5D74292FB1DDD38E40B578C73A9BEF3E2DC", "hash": "AC1DB5D74292FB1DDD38E40B578C73A9BEF3E2DC", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 1, "peers": 0, "size": "758.82 MB", "size_bytes": 795680440, "date_uploaded": "2017-06-28 05:55:18", "date_uploaded_unix": 1498622118}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/D47E51FE124439B12A9A009B5E3E51EEAAAFDE24", "hash": "D47E51FE124439B12A9A009B5E3E51EEAAAFDE24", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 1, "peers": 0, "size": "1.58 GB", "size_bytes": 1696512082, "date_uploaded": "2017-06-28 07:46:56", "date_uploaded_unix": 1498628816}], "date_uploaded": "2017-06-28 05:55:18", "date_uploaded_unix": 1498622118}, {"id": 6597, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/their-finest-2016", "imdb_code": "tt1661275", "title": "Their Finest", "title_english": "Their Finest", "title_long": "Their Finest (2016)", "slug": "their-finest-2016", "year": 2016, "rating": 6.8, "runtime": 117, "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance", "War"], "download_count": 179578, "like_count": 60, "description_intro": "During the London Blitz of World War II, Catrin Cole is recruited by the British Ministry of Information to write scripts for propaganda films that the public will actually watch without scoffing.
