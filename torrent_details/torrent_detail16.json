Led by Colonel Georges Geraud and General Paul DeMarchand, the struggling settlers have made a thriving community, called Demopolis, by the summer of 1819. On a shopping trip to Mobile, Fleurette DeMarchand, the General's daughter, meets John Breen, a Kentucky rifleman, who detours his regiment through Demopolis to court her. But Fleurette, despite her wish to marry for love, must bow to the needs of her fellow exiles, who are at the mercy of the rich and wealthy Blake Randolph, and who wants her as his bride. But John Breen has no intention of allowing that to happen, resigns from his regiment, and takes up the fight against Randolph and his hirelings.", "yt_trailer_code": "pVh9ZszFU0U", "language": "English", "mpa_rating": "", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/large-cover.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/medium-screenshot1.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/medium-screenshot2.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/medium-screenshot3.jpg", "large_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/large-screenshot1.jpg", "large_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/large-screenshot2.jpg", "large_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/The_Fighting_Kentuckian_1949/large-screenshot3.jpg", "cast": [{"name": "John Wayne", "character_name": "John Breen", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000078.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000078"}, {"name": "Paul Fix", "character_name": "Beau Merritt", "imdb_code": "0280707"}, {"name": "Oliver Hardy", "character_name": "Willie Paine", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001316.jpg", "imdb_code": "0001316"}, {"name": "Hank Worden", "character_name": "Abner Todd", "imdb_code": "0941401"}], "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/72C43726B40A82A938BD8E5A9717E19955A652DD", "hash": "72C43726B40A82A938BD8E5A9717E19955A652DD", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 1, "peers": 8, "size": "757.55 MB", "size_bytes": 794348749, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 02:30:58", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446341458}], "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 02:30:58", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446341458}, {"id": 3264, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/the-final-destination-2009", "imdb_code": "tt1144884", "title": "The Final Destination", "title_english": "The Final Destination", "title_long": "The Final Destination (2009)", "slug": "the-final-destination-2009", "year": 2009, "rating": 5.2, "runtime": 82, "genres": ["Action", "Fantasy", "Horror", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "download_count": 244307, "like_count": 157, "description_intro": "While watching a car race at McKinley Speedway, Nick O'Bannon has a premonition of a car crash that will result in many casualties, including several people that are in the audience.

Will the truth come out?", "description_full": "Balls-out 60 Minutes (1968) Producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) sniffs a story when a former research biologist for Brown & Williamson, Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe), won't talk to him. When the company leans hard on Wigand to honor a confidentiality agreement, he gets his back up. Trusting Bergman, and despite a crumbling marriage, he goes on camera for a Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) interview and risks arrest for contempt of court. Westinghouse is negotiating to buy CBS, so CBS attorneys advise CBS News to shelve the interview and avoid a lawsuit. 60 Minutes (1968) and CBS News bosses cave, Wigand is hung out to dry, Bergman is compromised, and the CEOs of Big Tobacco may get away with perjury.
