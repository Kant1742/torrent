At the center of the film are three U.S. military veterans. Plagued by guilt over participating in the killing of faceless people in foreign countries, they decide to speak out publicly, despite the possible consequences. Their stories take dramatic turns, leading one of the protagonists to Afghanistan where she learns about a horrendous incident. But her journey also gives hope for peace and redemption. National Bird gives rare insight into the U.S. drone program through the eyes of veterans and survivors, connecting their stories as never seen before in a documentary. Its images haunt the audience and bring a faraway issue close to home.",

The job has provided Lina with sufficient earnings to live frugally and have enough left over to send money back home to her son Junior who has grown from a small child to an adolescent in her absence. Now, with Christmas just around the corner, Lina is finally preparing to return to Lima for a belated visit. The thing is, Junior seems more concerned about getting an authentic soccer jersey than reuniting with his mother. What's more, Lina's bank account is in danger of getting drained when her employer's newly installed pool is unexpectedly damaged under her watch.",

He's Albert, an illegal alien from Belgium, serving as chauffeur and lover to a string of powerful men. She's Stella, a real estate agent with several women lovers. When he's out of a job, she temporarily takes him in. He becomes her cook and housekeeper, time passes, and they marry so he won't be deported. Later, after a boozy birthday celebration with him, she finds herself pregnant. They try to be a family, love grows, and she puts her career on hold as his career, as a fashion designer, takes off. Can this gay couple stay true to each other, and what happens when their hormones call?",

To Alison's mother, Diana, Daniel is a hero. To Alison's boyfriend, Carson, Daniel is a threat whose stories don't quite add up. Daniel charms his way into Diana's heart and home, but Alison grows suspicious of his odd and protective behavior. When Alison's loved ones start to go missing, she discovers Daniel isn't who he says he is, and that he has a dark past with a body count. \"Daniel\" won't stop until Alison belongs to him, and she must stop him before Kevin and Diana become his next victims.",

Gripped tells the story of Rose, a gym climber from Los Angeles on her first outdoor climb. While bouldering with her friend Jade, Rose falls for Bret, an experienced outdoorsman. She talks him into taking her - against his better judgment - on a famous, advanced rock-climbing route called \"Killer Pillar.\" Disaster strikes when Bret falls and suffers a serious head injury and torn shoulder. With no way to go but up, Rose has to lead the climb to the summit. When night falls they still have a long way to go and are forced to bivouac on a cliffside ledge. The next day, as a storm approaches, Bret drifts in and out of consciousness. It's up to Rose to save them both.",

It is the beginning of a new generation of kids called the \"hip hop\" generation, which unfortunately was growing up alongside the \"crack cocaine\" generation. Karon falls into a deep sleep after his graduation in 1985. His dreams within dreams take him into a realistic drama along with his potential future in the 1990s as a drug-selling youth. His fast money attitude serves as the detriment to the community and ultimately his best friends become caught in the crossfire of his illicit activity. He awakens back in 1985, realizing the \"easy way out\" that was offered wasn't a glorious new beginning, it was the end.",
        "description_full": "This is a coming-of-age story about five teenagers growing up in Harlem, New York in the 1980s. It is the beginning of a new generation of kids called the \"hip hop\" generation, which unfortunately was growing up alongside the \"crack cocaine\" generation. Karon falls into a deep sleep after his graduation in 1985. His dreams within dreams take him into a realistic drama along with his potential future in the 1990s as a drug-selling youth. His fast money attitude serves as the detriment to the community and ultimately his best friends become caught in the crossfire of his illicit activity. He awakens back in 1985, realizing the \"easy way out\" that was offered wasn't a glorious new beginning, it was the end.",

Human Nature is a provocative exploration of CRISPR's far-reaching implications, through the eyes of the scientists who discovered it, the families its affecting, and the bio-engineers who are testing its limits. How will this new power change our relationship with nature? What will it mean for human evolution?

This movie centers around Pilot Officer Peter Penrose (Sir John Mills), fresh out of a training unit, who joins the squadron, and quickly discovers about life during war time. He falls for Iris Winterton (Ren\u00e9e Asherson), a young girl who lives at the local hotel, but he becomes disillusioned about marriage when the squadron commander dies in a raid, and leaves his wife, the hotel manager, with a young son to bring up. As the war progresses, Penrose comes to terms that he has survived, while others have been killed.",

Sonic Sea features several charismatic scientists, including Ken Balcomb, the former Navy pilot and acoustics expert who proved to the world that naval sonar is killing whales, as well as the musician and environmental activist, Sting, whose moving interview connects the sonic world of marine life with our sonic world on land.

In high hopes that something good might come out of it, Guy finally approaches the cryptic multi-million tycoon, intent on exploiting him; instead, the ambitious opportunist finds himself mysteriously hired by Mr Arkadin, to reconstruct the history of his murky past before 1927. However, as the methodical detective scours the globe to put together the dangerously knotty puzzle, people end up dead, gradually closing in on Van Stratten, who now begins to shed light on this murderously difficult assignment. Are those cases linked together? In the end, has the reclusive magnate something to hide?",
