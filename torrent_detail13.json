As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own.", "yt_trailer_code": "emIHzg4VH8A", "language": "English", "mpa_rating": "R", "background_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/background.jpg", "background_image_original": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/background.jpg", "small_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/small-cover.jpg", "medium_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/medium-cover.jpg", "large_cover_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/large-cover.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/medium-screenshot1.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/medium-screenshot2.jpg", "medium_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/medium-screenshot3.jpg", "large_screenshot_image1": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/large-screenshot1.jpg", "large_screenshot_image2": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/large-screenshot2.jpg", "large_screenshot_image3": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/movies/Insomnia_2002/large-screenshot3.jpg", "cast": [{"name": "Maura Tierney", "character_name": "Rachel Clement", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0005491.jpg", "imdb_code": "0005491"}, {"name": "Al Pacino", "character_name": "Will Dormer", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000199.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000199"}, {"name": "Robin Williams", "character_name": "Walter Finch", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0000245.jpg", "imdb_code": "0000245"}, {"name": "Hilary Swank", "character_name": "Ellie Burr", "url_small_image": "https://yts.mx/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0005476.jpg", "imdb_code": "0005476"}], "torrents": [{"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/FA227A1E1FF574C01A4D24D44B1A1FB3C77C5ABC", "hash": "FA227A1E1FF574C01A4D24D44B1A1FB3C77C5ABC", "quality": "720p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 26, "peers": 8, "size": "751.67 MB", "size_bytes": 788183122, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 00:17:40", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446333460}, {"url": "https://yts.mx/torrent/download/A28C3A1470FE39A9A88A70E48AD37E8DA2AF3FF0", "hash": "A28C3A1470FE39A9A88A70E48AD37E8DA2AF3FF0", "quality": "1080p", "type": "bluray", "seeds": 149, "peers": 24, "size": "1.84 GB", "size_bytes": 1975684956, "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 00:17:42", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446333462}], "date_uploaded": "2015-11-01 00:17:40", "date_uploaded_unix": 1446333460}, {"id": 1631, "url": "https://yts.mx/movies/the-divergent-series-insurgent-2015", "imdb_code": "tt2908446", "title": "The Divergent Series: Insurgent", "title_english": "The Divergent Series: Insurgent", "title_long": "The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015)", "slug": "the-divergent-series-insurgent-2015", "year": 2015, "rating": 6.2, "runtime": 119, "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller"], "download_count": 2553246, "like_count": 1023, "description_intro": "As she searches for allies and answers in the wake of the uprising, Tris and Four are on the run.

This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise, which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage.

Facing other internal obstacles which have resulted in what they consider a string of bad luck, Aubrey ultimately uses Maturin's scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the ship's seemingly impossible goal.", "description_full": "In April 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars, H.M.S.
